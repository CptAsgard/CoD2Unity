# Current status
This Unity project can currently load D3DBSP and IWI files. It's only been tested on Call of Duty 2, and only on multiplayer maps (maps with the mp_ prefix). The to-do list of this project currently is: 

- Load objects from the map
- Implement the old loading screens
- Implement the old menu

I do not have any intention of creating a remake of Call of Duty 2, and I will therefore most likely not implement any type of multiplayer or FPS mechanics. The goal for me is to learn about reverse engineering and map formats.

As this is a fan project, and made purely for personal interest and entertainment, I will not be accepting any pull requests introducing new features. However, I will most likely accept bug fixes and performance improvements where necessary.
